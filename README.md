# Project 02
# Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent insurance claims. It utilizes a dataset of insurance claims and employs various techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Exploring the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis to understand patterns and insights.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.
* **Model Training:** Utilizing a logistic regression model with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for handling class imbalance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
* **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Visualizing the model's predictions and identifying potential areas for improvement.

**Insights:**

* The analysis reveals challenges posed by class imbalance in the dataset.
* Despite using SMOTE, the model exhibits limitations in terms of precision and recall, indicating potential areas for improvement.
* The confusion matrix highlights the presence of false positives and false negatives, suggesting the need for further model refinement.

**Recommendations:**

* Explore more powerful models better equipped to handle imbalanced data, such as Random Forest or XGBoost.
* Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance.
* Consider incorporating additional features or data sources to enhance model accuracy.

This project provides a foundation for building a robust fraud detection system for insurance claims. Further research and development are encouraged to improve the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent activities.
